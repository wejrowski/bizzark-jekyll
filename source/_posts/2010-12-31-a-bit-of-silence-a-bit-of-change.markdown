<p>
	I haven&#39;t been too active here. One new website posted in the last 6 months, and not too many blog posts. I also had a sweet e-newsletter going for a few months. Then the tides turned and everything stopped. I am alive, and still coding and designing, among other things. Just not as much under <em><strong>Bizzark</strong></em>. I&#39;ve been doing majority of my work under a few other local companies, which is why everything here kind of came to a halt. I decided to step back off the stressful pursuit of marketing myself and let other people feed me the work. Much more fun. Unfortunately I don&#39;t think I can post any of the fun stuff I have been working on (A ton of Wordpress websites, some RoR apps, a bit of Flash, and some other random stuff..).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That being said, the work area will probably be continue being pretty lifeless for a while. &nbsp;But I have some hopes to start some more miscellaneous blog posts. To be continued...</p>
