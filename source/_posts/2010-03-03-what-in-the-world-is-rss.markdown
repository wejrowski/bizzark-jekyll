	Or those bright orange RSS icons? Most probably don&#39;t notice them. If you&#39;ve ever clicked them you&#39;ll know that it takes you to a funky format of information. It looks pretty boring. This is an RSS feed.&nbsp;What is it? It&#39;s a standard format of information that makes it easy for computers to decode and understand. It stands for &quot;Really Simple Syndication,&quot; or &quot;Rich Site Summary.&quot; Typically you will find these on websites that have a lot of updates, especially blogs and news websites. What would you do with it?</p>

They allow you to have view things like blogs in one location without going to the actual website. If you browse a lot websites, it would be pretty tedious to visit each site, much less remember them.&nbsp;I currently am subscribed to 117 blogs. I confess many of these I don&#39;t keep tabs on all the time. But keeping these organized through a reader helps me remember them, and browse through them at my convenience. &nbsp;There are a lot of online applications and software that allow you to organize and read blogs. I personally like, and would highly suggest&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> because it is all stored online, and it is very easy to organize and use. Google Reader is set as my home page, and when I have free time I&#39;ll browse my subscriptions and find interesting articles to read (as well as do this in down time on my phone).</p>

			change your life</h1>
		I say everyone really should read blogs. You could probably find a decent blog on virtually any topic. For myself I read mostly design, programming, and photography blogs, as well as blogs from friends and authors, and news. It helps me keep informed about what&#39;s going on in specific industries, peoples&#39; lives, get inspired, and it can even be a good way to communicate with others, via comments and responses. It&#39;s an invaluable resource for staying informed, inspired, and educated.</div>
