	Welcome to the new website. After many months of planning and many hours of work, I&#39;ve finally completed the new website along with a new CMS. Why would I create another website? Well apart from it being due time, I thought I would simplify the layout of the website and make it a bit more usable, likable, and useful to the average person (unfortunately some were a bit taken back by the craziness of the 3d background on the old website). Also I thought I would better showcase what I&#39;m capable of by not only building this website in a custom programmed <a href="/content-management-systems">content management system</a>, but by adding practical features that I&#39;ve used with other clients (Testimonials, Twitter &amp; Facebook integration, nifty interactions etc.).&nbsp;</p>

	<img alt="" src="/images/attachments/page_18/welcomecms.gif" style="margin-left: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: right; width: 325px; height: 270px; " />Behind this nifty website is a content management system (or CMS) that I have built. It&#39;s a system that&#39;s evolved over the last couple years; one that I have built to be a foundation for future projects and website, allowing for more complex features while still keeping a simple interface for people like you to manage your website super easily. The system was hand coded myself from scratch using Ruby on Rails (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails" target="_blank">read more about Rails</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/applications" target="_blank">view well known Ruby on Rails websites</a>). In the future I plan on releasing a public version of the CMS which will allow you to log in and see how it works yourself. Stay tuned for that.</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, subscribe to my RSS feed to stay tuned for future blogs and work (<a href="/what-in-the-world-is-rss">click here for more info on blogs and RSS feeds</a>). I plan on writing posts regularly. Hopefully it will all be useful and intriguing information pertaining to websites and this crazy world of the internet.</p>

	Thanks for stopping by!</p>
