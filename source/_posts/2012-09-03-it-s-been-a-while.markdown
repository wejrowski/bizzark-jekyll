<p>
	Ja, ich habe etwas nicht in eine weile hier getan. That&#39;s german for I haven&#39;t done anything here in a while (...and I&#39;m learning German). We&#39;ll see where the German thing goes&mdash;and this blog post / website for that matter. Shortly after I revamped and rethought this website for frelance business I started doing more contract work and moved into full time positions. I didn&#39;t keep close attention to the website after that since I didn&#39;t want to draw many people to it (wasn&#39;t looking for more freelance).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	That said, at some point I should rework the website to be less geared towards that, and more geared towards what I&#39;m doing as a programmer, wherever I&#39;m at. So, for the time being, I may touch base every so often just to give some insight into the zeros and ones in my brain (or the programming side of my thought life).&nbsp;</p>

	Sprechen Ihnen bald (talk to you soon)!</p>
