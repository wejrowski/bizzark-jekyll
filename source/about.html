  <h2>I code, design, and think web.</h2>
  <p>My journey writing zeros and ones in this web universe began over 10 years ago writing Actionscript and HTML. Two years later I started coding backend and building Content Management Systems in my free time. My programming life started with the web, and thus I&#39;ve grown accustom to being a web centric thinker. I&#39;m an addicted learner by nature, and continually refine and evolve my knowledge of web development, making for relevant, coherent, creative and dynamic websites.</p>
  <p>Over the years I&#39;ve worked with a number of brands including Nike, FiestaBowl, Statefarm, Desert Botanical Garden, and Arizona Office of Tourism. I currently work with Infusionsoft. And, when I&#39;m not programming you can typically find me with a book in my hand, learning something new, or pondering what it means to be human.</p>
